This week we examine why David Vasquez has such a strong hatred for Netlify CMS. David has made many negative statements about Netlify in the past such as "when Netlify sends us its blog posts, they're not sending us their best. They're sending us their criminal blog posts, thei rrapists blog posts..." What does this even mean? He's been going around the country saying he wants to make "blogging great again!" Well, when WAS blogging great David?
